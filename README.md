# Viswanath Bodapati's Portfolio Website

I'd like to introduce myself as a third-year B.Tech. student who self-learns with an information technology focus. The JavaScript library React JS was used to create this website. I have experience with web development as well as machine learning. On the website, you may see what fascinates me. Using Git Bash, pushed the files to the repo's gh-pages branch. You can find out more about me by visiting the active github sites.
